This a fully featured ASP.NET MVC application that I built while copmpleting the Mosh Hamedani MVC online course.
Obviously this means that most of this code was not written by me independantly, but I'm still proud of the end result.
Features:
-> SQL Server Database built and maintained using Code First Migrations
-> Both Server Side and Client Side (jQuery) form validation
-> Full user login functionality with different levels of user access for Store Managers, Employees, and Customers
-> Create and Delete functions for movie, customer, and rental objects
-> Full separation of concerns according to MVC design paradigm
-> a nice suite of CSS, jQuery, and Boostrap effects and styles for forms, dropdown menus, and links
